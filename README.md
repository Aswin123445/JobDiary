# Job Diary - AI-Powered Job Application Tracker

## Overview

Job hunting can be overwhelming, especially when you submit 60+ applications and struggle to keep track of follow-ups, interview calls, and your research notes for each company. Job Diary helps you stay organized by storing all your job applications and detailed company/job research in one place.

With Job Diary, you can also generate AI-powered summaries of your research on demand â€” so you have quick, concise reports to review before interviews or follow-ups. Plus, automated email reminders help you never miss a follow-up for pending applications.

The app features secure email-based authentication using Authlib, and uses the Groq API for smart AI-generated summaries.
